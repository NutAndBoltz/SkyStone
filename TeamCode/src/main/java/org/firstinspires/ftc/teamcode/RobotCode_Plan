RobotVariable Interface should contain all the variables we need,
such as wheel circumference, speed, etc

RobotMovement should contain all the common movements in both Autonomous and TeleOp
such as goForward, backward, etc

For Go Right/Left, there are other methods declared: TurnRight/Left
Go Right/Left is method merged with TurnRight/Left and linear movement

If this is done, we should be able to simply extend RobotMovement class on Auton/TeleOp class
**important
Use annonymous class to add up the varying functions, to use pre-declared methods
==>See TestClass

ToDo List
- Decide what wheel we are going to use (I don't think Encoder will be precise if we keep using same wheels now)
        -Test if the wheels we are currently using is accurate in high speed, use it
        -Or do some physics calculation(Is friction constant in specificant of our wheel?)
- Linear Movement speed adjustment system so that robot doesn't have to slide/ grind some gears due to rapid stop)
        -Quite important to make sure it's not sliding when start moving and stop moving.
- Figure out How to get Encoder data from our robot(this depends on motor, if I'm right, if not, tell me)
- micro Code System(look programming team flowchart slide) for Auton Code so that we can import it on Auton
- Clean some codes & come up with better system
