/**
 * This file demonstrates how to play one of the several SKYSTONE/Star Wars sounds loaded into the SDK.
 * It does this by creating a simple "chooser" controlled by the gamepad Up Down buttons.
 * This code also prevents sounds from stacking up by setting a "playing" flag, which is cleared when the sound finishes playing.
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
 *
 * Operation:
 *      Use the DPAD to change the selected sound, and the Right Bumper to play it.
